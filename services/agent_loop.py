"""Provider-agnostic agentic tool loop.

This module houses the two halves of the multi-turn tool loop that used to live
entirely inside ``OpenAIAgentService``:

  - :class:`LoopController` — the **provider-agnostic** loop *sequencer*: only
    the cross-cutting guards every provider shares — the iteration cap, the
    wall-clock timeout, inter-iteration backoff, canonicalized loop-detection,
    and the stop/limit messages. It knows nothing about any specific provider; it
    drives a :class:`TurnEngine` and forwards its events.
  - :class:`TurnEngine` — the interface a provider adapter implements, plus the
    :class:`OpenAITurnEngine` adapter that speaks the OpenAI-compatible dialect
    (delta reassembly over ``LLMRouter.stream_openai_raw``, tool-call
    normalization, per-tool gated execution, telemetry, usage accounting, and the
    malformed-tool-JSON heuristic).

Each engine owns its own message-history dialect, SSE event vocabulary, tool
execution/gating, and telemetry; the controller only ever sees provider-agnostic
:class:`TurnResult` / :class:`ToolPhaseResult` values. This lets a future
``AnthropicTurnEngine`` keep native Anthropic-block history, emit thinking
events, and batch-execute tools without the controller having to know.

Behaviour here is a straight lift of the previous ``OpenAIAgentService.stream``
loop — the split is structural, not behavioural.

class AnthropicTurnEngine:
    """Anthropic-native :class:`TurnEngine` over ``client.messages.stream``.

    Wraps a ``ClaudeService`` instance and reuses its proven helpers
    (``async_client.messages.stream``, ``_process_mixed_tool_use``,
    ``_clean_blocks_for_resend``, ``_persist_interaction``). Lifted from the
    body of ``ClaudeService.chat_stream``:

      - ``stream_turn`` emits ``thinking_start``/``thinking``/``thinking_end`` and
        ``text`` deltas, reads final usage via ``get_final_message()``, and
        persists the reasoning trace — one interaction row per iteration.
      - ``execute_tools`` runs the turn's tool calls as a single batch through
        ``_process_mixed_tool_use`` and appends the Anthropic-block tool results.

    Canonical history is Anthropic content-block shape (native to this engine),
    so no conversion happens at the boundary. Approval gating is intentionally
    absent here — it matches ``chat_stream``'s current behaviour and is unified
    across providers in a later sub-PR.
