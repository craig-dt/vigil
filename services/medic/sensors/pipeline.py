"""Bus → redaction choke point → id → schema check → sink. The only way out.

Fail closed: an observation the choke point can't process is dropped and counted
(`redactor_failures`), never written raw; one that fails the schema is dropped and
counted (`dropped`). `id`/`seq` are assigned only to observations that reach the
sink, so a run's seq has no gaps (observation.schema.json `sensor.seq`).
