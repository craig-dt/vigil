# Medic

Medic is the ops-health watcher for a Vigil install (program name: System
Watcher). It watches the install's own health, not security alerts. Phase 0 is
observe-only: no fixes, and nothing leaves the site.

It is **off by default**. `VIGIL_MEDIC_ENABLED=true` turns it on; anything else
and `run` logs why and exits 0.

```
python -m services.medic run     # the service (below)
python -m services.medic check   # exit 0 only if the heartbeat is fresh (< 120 s)
python -m services.medic check --ready  # exit 0 only if the API answers the status op (Helm readiness)
```

`run` works in 15 s cycles: the sensors that are due read (`http_ready` on the
agent worker's `/readyz`), every observation passes the K2 redaction choke, the
engine evaluates the tick, router R1 gives each incident its rule's lane, and the
store's single writer chains the record into `medic.db`. Each cycle then saves
the engine state and writes the heartbeat; a loop that stops cycling for 180 s
is ended by the watchdog. On start, if the last heartbeat shows Medic was
stalled or off, one `gap` record goes into the chain first. Rules are the
dev-mode set in `rules/dev/` (no pack loader yet, F6).

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_ENABLED` | off |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/vigil-medic` (macOS: `/Library/Application Support/vigil-medic`) |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_INSTALL_SHAPE` | `compose` (`start_sh`, `compose` or `helm`) |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_AGENT_WORKER_ADDR` | `agent-worker:6990` (`start_sh`: `127.0.0.1:6990`); `host:port` only |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_POLICY_PROBE_ADDR` | Helm only, and required there (the chart sets it): a `host:port` Medic's NetworkPolicy must block |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_POLICY_CONTROL_ADDR` | Helm only, and required there: a `host:port` on the same pods that the policy allows |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_API_PORT` | `8470`: where `GET /v1/status` listens. On `127.0.0.1` unless `VIGIL_MEDIC_INSTALL_SHAPE` is set to `compose` (the one address that reaches `VIGIL_MEDIC_API_BIND_PEER`) or `helm` (every interface of the pod) |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_API_BIND_PEER` | Compose: `medic-gateway-out`, the gateway's `medic-private` alias, so the API isn't on `medic-net` beside the agents. Elsewhere unset |
| `VIGIL_MEDIC_API_KEY_FILE` | The file holding `X-Medic-Key` (43 base64url characters). Default: Compose `/run/secrets/medic_api_key`; host-native `<data dir>/run/api_key` (written by the restart loop); Helm none (the chart sets it) |

**API (X2, S9 slice).** `run` serves `GET /v1/status` from a snapshot each cycle
publishes (never older than one 15 s tick; older than two and it answers `503
busy`). Every request needs `X-Medic-Key`, compared in constant time with the
key file, which is re-read per request; anything else is `401`, then `404` for
any other path and `405` for any other method, as RFC 9457 problem JSON. The
other X2 operations are G3's. A listener that can't start (no key, port taken)
is logged once and retried every minute; it never stops Medic or fails `check`.

On Helm, `run` first connects to the control (retried for up to a minute while
it starts), then tries the probe target. Only "control connected, target
dropped or refused" proves NetworkPolicy is enforced (a plugin set to REJECT
refuses, S7-2); a refusal must hold for three tries 5 s apart, since a Service
whose endpoints haven't appeared yet is refused too. Anything else, and Medic
logs why and exits **3** before opening its store (A3-3).

Data directory: `medic.db` (+ `-wal`, `-shm`), `medic.lock`, `instance_id`,
`run/heartbeat`, `run/engine-state.json`, `run/starts.json` (restarts and the last
exit reason for `/v1/status`), and host-native only `run/api_key`. `python -m services.medic.store verify`
checks the chain.

## Isolation

Medic imports nothing from `core`, `tools` or any other service, and has its own
`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`; `.importlinter` enforces the first. Its runtime
dependencies go in this `pyproject.toml` only, never in the repo's requirements.
If `uv.lock` conflicts after a merge, re-run `uv lock --project services/medic`
rather than hand-merging.

## Tests

One command, from the repo root:

```
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=../../.venv uv run --project services/medic pytest services/medic
```

It runs the contract tests (`contracts/tests/`) and Medic's own (`tests/`). The
venv goes in the repo root's `.venv` (gitignored, and unused by Vigil, which
uses `venv/`). Left in `services/medic/.venv`, the repo's ratchet tests, which
scan every `.py` file under `services/`, would read the venv's site-packages.

Lint, the same as the `medic-contracts` CI job:

```
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=../../.venv uv run --project services/medic ruff check services/medic
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=../../.venv uv run --project services/medic ruff format --check services/medic
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=../../.venv uv run --project services/medic lint-imports
```

## Contracts

`contracts/` holds the schemas, fixtures, evaluation vectors, reference
implementations and their tests. They are the spec: a vector or schema that
looks wrong is a contract change, made in its own PR, never a code workaround.

## Image

`infra/docker/Dockerfile.medic`: Medic's venv from this lock, no `core`, uid and
gid 10001, read-only root filesystem, `HEALTHCHECK` running `check`. Mount the
data volume at `/var/lib/vigil-medic`.

```
docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile.medic -t vigil-medic .
```
